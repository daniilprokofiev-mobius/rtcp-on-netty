Default workflow is:
> Open message: 263 (329) bytes
> Data message: 272 (338) bytes
> Response message: 252 (318) bytes
> Termination message: 244 (310) bytes

10000 messages works fine if:
> BUFFER_SIZE in Network Manager is 256 * 1024 * 2 = 524 288
> wmem and rmem in system is 256 * 1024 * 2 = 524 288

If buffer is default (256 * 1024):
> 6000 - OK (if all other tabs are closed)
> After Wireshark was opened - 6000 not OK (it may consume resources)
